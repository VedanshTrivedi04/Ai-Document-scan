"""
FastAPI application entrypoint.

Auth, cases, document upload + the analysis pipeline, risk scoring,
reviewer actions, per-case PDF report export, the admin Settings API and
the audit history, and the platform-admin API (companies, billing/usage, queue
monitor) are wired up. Multi-tenant: see docs/multi-tenancy.md. MIS/compliance reporting (app/api/reports.py) is still a stub.
