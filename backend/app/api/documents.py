"""
Document upload.

One file per request by design (see frontend/src/pages/NewCasePage.tsx):
a case commonly has several supporting documents, and the frontend
calls this endpoint once per selected file, all against the same
case_id, so they share it for cross-document checks later.

After the DB record commits, five independent Celery tasks are
enqueued so the upload response doesn't block on any of their latency:
OCR + classification + extraction (app/tasks/document_processing.py,
which itself chains into field_validation/issuer_verification once it
succeeds — see app/tasks/document_checks.py), PDF metadata forensics
(app/tasks/metadata_forensics_task.py), image-tampering detection — ELA
+ copy-move (app/tasks/tampering_checks_task.py), duplicate/near-
duplicate detection (app/tasks/duplicate_check_task.py), and visual
inconsistency review + AI-generated-content assessment (app/tasks/
visual_inconsistency_task.py). The latter four only read the raw file's
own bytes/rendered pages, not anything extraction produces, so all four
run in parallel rather than waiting. The frontend polls case detail and
shows `processing_status`/each check's status until they settle. Still
out of scope here: cross-document checks and risk scoring — those are
separate, later pipeline stages.
