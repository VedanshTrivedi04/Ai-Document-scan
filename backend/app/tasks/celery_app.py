"""
Celery application instance — wired to Redis (broker + result backend) via
env-var-driven settings.

QUEUES — one per external dependency, each served by its own independently
scalable worker pool (start-worker.sh <queue>):

  extraction_queue  Azure Document Intelligence (OCR/layout) — process_document.
                    Calls are globally capped (default 10/s, under Azure's 15
                    TPS) by app/services/rate_limiter.py; size this pool to
                    just saturate that cap.
  vision_queue      Azure OpenAI — visual-inconsistency / AI-generation review,
                    signature detection + comparison, issuer verification's
                    semantic fallback. Capped at the deployment's RPM
                    (AZURE_OPENAI_MAX_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE); size to saturate it.
  forensics_queue   Local CPU only — metadata forensics, ELA + copy-move,
                    duplicate hashing — plus the light DB steps (cross-document
                    check, risk scoring). NO rate limit: scale freely with
                    cores, down to zero replicas when there is no work.
  housekeeping_queue  Periodic platform jobs (queue metrics, usage
                    reconciliation, stuck-document recovery). Served by the
                    single beat container (start-beat.sh runs beat + a
                    one-slot worker for this queue), so these every-minute
                    jobs never wake the forensics workers.

FAIRNESS — every document's every step is its own task (enqueued per
document by app/api/documents.py; no task ever processes a whole batch or
case), all companies share the same queues, and dispatch is FAIR-SHARE PER
COMPANY (app/tasks/fairshare.py): each task's priority comes from how much
work its company already has outstanding on that queue, so one company's big
batch can't starve another company's single document. No company has a fixed
priority tier. With `worker_prefetch_multiplier=1` + `task_acks_late` a worker
holds only the task it is running.

`include` lists every task module because the worker process only imports
this module (never app.main).

Wait-time instrumentation (before_task_publish / task_prerun signals) feeds
the platform admin's queue monitor (app/services/queue_monitor.py).
