# FDDT documentation

**FDDT — Fraud Document Detection Tool** authenticates third-party documents (vendor invoices, school
documents, quotations, travel claims and the payment evidence behind them) *before* an approval or payment
is made. A user submits a **case** of PDF documents; the system extracts their data, runs a battery of
automated checks, turns the results into an **explainable** risk score, and hands the case to a human
reviewer (Reviewer L1, with escalation routing a case to Reviewer L2). Every step is written to an append-only audit log.
Several client companies share one deployment, each isolated from the others by the application and by
PostgreSQL Row-Level Security.

These docs describe the system **as implemented**, checked against the code. The capabilities included in the
current build, and those outside its scope, are collected in the table in
[architecture/overview.md](architecture/overview.md#scope-of-the-current-build).

## Document Contradiction Detector

Built on this platform for the problem statement "AI-Based Document Contradiction Detector for Public
Systems": one person's documents are compared with each other, harmless differences are ignored and real
conflicts are flagged for a reviewer.

## Ground rules the design follows

These principles explain many choices you will meet in the code:

- **No model is trained or hosted.** Intelligence is a managed cloud API or a classical library.
- **A transparent rules engine, not a model, produces the risk score**, with versioned, admin-tunable rules.
- **One generic, template-free extraction pipeline** for every document type.
- **Original files are immutable** and hash-verified; everything else derives from them.
- **The audit log is append-only.**
- **Weak signals are labelled weak** — signature comparison, AI-generation detection and ELA are advisory,
  never verdicts, and never described as "verified".
- **The UI is English-only**; only extracted Arabic values need right-to-left handling.

## Keeping these docs true

- The **OpenAPI snapshot** and the **database docs** are generated — regenerate them rather than editing:
  `api/openapi.json` (command in [api/README.md](api/README.md#regenerating-the-snapshot)); `database/*.md`
  with `cd backend && .venv/Scripts/python ../docs/tools/gen_db_docs.py` against the migrated local Postgres
  — re-run after every migration.
- The **pipeline docs** quote real constants, thresholds and result shapes. When you change an algorithm or a
  default rule, update its page and the rule tables (the default rules live in
  `backend/app/services/risk_rule_seed.py` and the platform's `risk_rule_templates`).
- When you add or change a capability listed in the overview's scope table, update that table.
- The **PDFs in `docs-pdf/`** are built from these Markdown files (and `api/openapi.json`) — never edit them
  by hand. After changing any doc, rebuild: `cd docs/tools && npm install && npm run build`
  (see [tools/README.md](tools/README.md)).
